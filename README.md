Although the account system does not work and some incomplete areas, the main thing is the saving feature ( which can be accessed again if you save the link ), when making notes.
There is currently only one template:  
- The Cornell Notetaking method, but additional ones are expected to be added soon.

# Summary of functionality:

1. "Fetch": Fetchs the latest saved data from the database, it does not auto-generate due to call-limits to the firestore api.
2. "+": adds a clean set of template to be written for the next topic/day.    It has a separate saving button than the rest, so make sure to click the right one when you are to save.


# Features to add:

1. More note-taking templates and features ( Possibility making your own template )
3. User Authentication System, adding a quick-way to access all your previous notes
4. Add Mark-up to the notes to make them prettier.
5. Export the notes somehow.
